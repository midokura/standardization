# Contributing

Our intent is that these standardization guides are a joint effort of Midokura's Engineering team. We will designate a group of maintainers for the repository that represents all teams in the company that will be ultimately responsible for approving contributions.  However, every engineer is welcome to participate in the reviews.

## How to Contribute

All contributions must be done using a **Pull Request**:

1. Create a Pull Request with a descriptive title; Explain in detail the context and motivation of your PR and why you think the change is relevant.
2. Request feedback from reviewers. Resolve any comments and doubts about your proposal. You're generally expected to address issues raised. *Try to add reviewers from different teams, departments, and reviewers with certain expertise on the topic you're proposal is about.* As more people with different points of view participate in a proposal, richer will be the content created.
3. Two maintainers must approve your PR. Maintainers will act as tie-breakers in case of no agreement. *Remember to Squash and Merge your changes*.

## Tips

1. Use data from verified sources to explain your idea.
2. Use your own words to explain your PR.
3. Quote external or internal contributors.
4. Add links to external Repositories, Papers, Documentation ...
5. Be kind. All employee's opinions and points of view are valuables.
6. Take your time to review other PRs. Their effort deserves your effort.
7. You can learn something new by carefully reading your teammate's feedback. Don't be afraid to change your idea.
8. Always give constructive feedback.
