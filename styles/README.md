# Style

Programming style is a set of rules or guidelines used to write a code. Following a particular coding style helps developers read and understand the code conforming to the style, and help to avoid introducing errors.

# Midokura Styles

The goal of this section is to defenie Midokura's coding style and format rules. 

Every developer is free to decide which tool to use to apply them. To enforce the rules implementation, before pushing the code to the main development branch, the code must comply with the defined rules.

## Java
