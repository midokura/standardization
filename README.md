# Midokura Standardization Guide

Midokura development ecosystem integrates multiple projects, programming languages, and architectures. This repository aims to help Midokura employees to adopt a similar way to code, test, and deploy Midokuras solutions.

The Midokura Standardization Guide is a space to discuss which code, test, and deploy practices every project should adopt to deliver high-quality user-centric solutions to Midokuras clients and customers. 


## What is a Standard?

A standard is a coding style, a programming language, a set of tools, or a practice adopted and commonly used by all Midokura employees. We share Midokura's goal to be a data-driven company. All employees are welcome to participate in the Midokura standards definition using proven facts and data collected from verified sources. Midokura's standards are continuously improving and must evolve jointly with new trends.
